# Dissolve 
## Solution Design Exercise

For this UX/UI design exercise I have loosely recreated the cost calulator using Bootstrap 4, HTML, and CSS. Note that not all options availible in the production model are accurately displayed here. 

To solve the presented issue I offer two prototypes with pros and cons for each of them. 

I believe that Prototype Two is the better solution for this issue as it fits more with the general clean styling of the Dissolve website. 

### Prototype 1
#### Usage of a Bootstrap 4 Alert

##### Pros:
* Large, difficult to overlook
* Requires no user action to trigger
* Pricing points are clearly defined

##### Cons: 
* Large, takes up a lot of space on the page
* Not the prettiest, more utilitarian
* Wordy

### Prototype 2
#### Usage of "form help" below option

##### Pros:
* Requires no user interaction
* Good looking
* Takes up minimal space
* Inline with form option
* Option cost displayed in dropdown additionally

##### Cons:
* Small, easy to overlook
